        <h3>Desription</h3>
        <p>This classic lasagna recipe features layers of rich meat sauce, creamy ricotta, and perfectly melted mozzarella, all nestled between sheets of tender pasta. Ground beef and Italian sausage are cooked with garlic, onions, and tomato sauce, creating a hearty filling. The ricotta is blended with eggs, fresh parsley, and parmesan for a smooth, flavorful layer, which contrasts beautifully with the savory meat sauce.</p>
        <p>The lasagna is assembled by layering the meat sauce, cheese mixture, and lasagna noodles, topped with extra mozzarella for a golden, bubbly finish. After baking, the lasagna becomes a comforting, cheesy dish with a perfect balance of textures and flavors, ideal for family dinners or special occasions. Let it rest for a few minutes before slicing to achieve perfect, cohesive layers in every bite.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Prepare the Meat Sauce<</b></li>
            <ul>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
                Add the chopped onions and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.
                Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant.
                Add ground beef and Italian sausage. Cook until browned, breaking it apart as it cooks.
                Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper.
                Let the sauce simmer for 20–30 minutes, stirring occasionally, to develop rich flavors.</ul>
                <li><b>Cook the Lasagan Noodles</b></li>
                <ul>Boil a large pot of salted water and cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente.
                    Drain and lay the noodles flat on parchment paper to prevent sticking.</ul>
                    <li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture</li>
                    <ul>In a bowl, mix ricotta cheese, 1 cup of shredded mozzarella, grated parmesan, egg, parsley, salt, and pepper until smooth and well combined.</ul>
                    <li><b>Assemble the Lasagna</b></li>
                    <ul>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
                        Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
                        Layer 3–4 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.
                        Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce.
                        Repeat the layering process (noodles, ricotta, meat sauce) until you've used all the ingredients, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.
                        Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella generously over the top layer.</ul>
                    <li><b>Bake the Lasagna</b></li>
                    <ul>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, ensuring it doesn't touch the cheese.
                        Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 15–20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</ul>
                        <li><b>Let it rest and serve</b></li>
                        <ul>Allow the lasagna to rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing to let the layers set.
                            Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired, and serve hot!</ul>
                    </ol>
