        <img src="https://assets-jpcust.jwpsrv.com/thumbnails/kq7i6rrr-720.jpg" alt="A photo of a finsihed dish of Jollof rice">
        <p>This is a foolproof recipe for cooking Jollof rice, West Africa’s most popular dish. I like to serve it as a side with my West African-style grilled beef (Suya), but it can also be a main course.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p><b>Tomato sauce</b></p>
        <ul>

<li>1 large, ripe tomato, cored and quartered

</li>
<li>1 large red bell pepper, seeded and roughly chopped

</li>
<li>1 whole habanero pepper, stem removed

</li>

<li>1 whole Fresno chili, or jalapeño, stem removed

</li>

<li>4 cloves garlic, peeled

</li>

<li>1 tablespoon minced ginger

</li>

<li>2 cups water

</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Rice</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>1/3 cup olive oil

    </li>
    <li>1 red onion, diced

    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste

    </li>
    <li>1/4 cup tomato paste

    </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons smoked paprika

    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon curry powder

    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin

    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme

    </li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

    </li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric

    </li>
    <li>2 1/4 cups basmati rice

    </li>
    <li>1 bay leaf

    </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chicken bouillon paste

    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol><li><b>Step 1</b></li>
<ul>Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, fresno chili, garlic, ginger, and water in a blender for the sauce. Blend on high until smooth and set aside.</ul>
<li><b>Step 2</b></li>
<ul>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and sauté until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and turmeric; continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined.</ul>
<li><b>Step 3
</b></li>
<ul>Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is coated with the oil-tomato mixture. Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste.

</ul>
<li><b>Step 4</b></li>
<ul>Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer. Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir rice.

</ul>
<li><b>Step 5</b></li>
<ul>Turn off heat after 20 minutes, and set the timer for 12 minutes. Allow rice to sit and do not remove the lid.

</ul>
<li><b>Step 6</b></li>
<ul>After the 12 minutes are up, remove lid, and fluff rice with a fork, separating all the grains. Serve garnished with green onions and chopped cilantro.

</ul>
</ol>
