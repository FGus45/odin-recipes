        <h1>Grilled Chicken</h1>
        <img src="https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Grilled-Chicken-Overhead.jpg" alt="A photo of a finished grilled chicken dish">
        <p>This grilled chicken recipe delivers juicy, flavorful chicken with a smoky, charred finish. Marinated in a blend of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and herbs, the chicken absorbs vibrant Mediterranean flavors that perfectly complement its natural richness. The marinade helps tenderize the meat while adding a bright, tangy taste that balances the char from the grill.</p>
        <p>Whether cooked over charcoal for extra smokiness or on a gas grill for convenience, the chicken develops a golden, crispy exterior while remaining moist and tender inside. Ideal for outdoor cookouts or a quick, healthy weeknight dinner, this grilled chicken pairs well with fresh salads, roasted vegetables, or a side of rice.</p>
